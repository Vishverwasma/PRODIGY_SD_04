1. Project Structure
•	Organize your project into different packages and classes to follow a modular design.
•	Example structure:
css
Copy code
com.sudoku.solver
-> Main.java
-> model
│  - -> SudokuGrid.java : 
-> service
│   -> SudokuSolverService.java
└──-> util
    -> InputHandler.java
    -> Validator.java
    -> Printer.java
2. Model Class
•	We Create a SudokuGrid class to represent the Sudoku grid.
•	This class will store the grid and provide methods for accessing and modifying the grid
3. Service Class
•	Create a SudokuSolverService class to handle the logic for solving the Sudoku.
•	This class will have methods similar to the ones in your original code but encapsulated within a service layer.
4. Utility Classes
•	InputHandler: Handles user input and grid initialization.
•	Validator: Validates the Sudoku grid.
•	Printer: Prints the Sudoku grid
6. Testing and Optimization
•	Implement unit tests for your methods to ensure they work correctly.
•	Optimize your algorithm if necessary, and consider adding features like different difficulty levels.
7. The utility classes, InputHandler, Validator, and Printer, which you can include in the com.sudoku.solver.util package.
a. InputHandler.java
This class is responsible for reading the Sudoku grid from user input.
b. Validator.java
This class contains validation methods. For simplicity, you can integrate the validation checks into the SudokuSolverService class as it's specific to the solving logic.
c. Printer.java
This class is responsible for printing the Sudoku grid.
8. Integrating Utility Classes
Ensure that you import the necessary classes in your SudokuSolverService and Main classes to use these utility classes.
